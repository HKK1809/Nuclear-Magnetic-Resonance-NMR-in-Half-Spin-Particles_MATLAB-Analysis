This Lab report focuses on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) in half spin particle. 
For the experiment glycerin and mineral oil were used. 
The experiment aims at measuring the spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation time for both using resonance frequency (RF) spectroscopy methodology.

The files in this repository include the data extracted for the experiemnt, the lab report containing the finding and the MTLAB code written to analyse the data.
